# Blockchain Based Cloud File Sharing System

## Overview

This project aims to create a secure and decentralized file sharing system using blockchain technology. The system leverages the principles of blockchain to provide a transparent, tamper-proof, and efficient file sharing platform in a cloud environment.

## Features

- **Decentralized Architecture:** Utilizes blockchain to eliminate the need for a central authority, enhancing security and reliability.

- **Smart Contracts:** Implements smart contracts for automated and secure file transactions, ensuring transparency and trust.

- **Immutable File History:** All file interactions are recorded on the blockchain, creating an immutable and auditable file history.

- **User Authentication:** Implements secure user authentication mechanisms for accessing and sharing files.

- **File Encryption:** Ensures end-to-end encryption(AES 256) for files, maintaining the privacy and integrity of shared data.
